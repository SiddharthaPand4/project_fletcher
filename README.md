# E-commerce Reviews Analysis
This project is about exploring topic modelings and unsupervised machine learning by analyzing e-commerce clothings reviews.

## Introduction  
In this project, I want to practice Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Unsupervised Machine Learning. 

After some research on what dataset I could obtain from the web, I found a [women clothings dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews) of a real e-commerce business. I think it could be cool and useful to a business if I could develop an automation for the business to extract insights from their clothing reviews. Because it is not easy to read thousands of reviews and it is a time consuming task.  

For complete write-up of this project, please go to my post on [medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/e-commerce-reviews-analysis-902210726d47?source=friends_link&sk=ac7a0a0cf41b1e333158b7c95e72252b).

## Project Design
The problem that I am trying to solve is to apply Natural Language Processiong (NLP) on reviews for [Topic Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model) and “separation” of good and bad reviews using [clustering](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/clustering-in-machine-learning/).
 
Secondary goal is to perform a supervised learning problem with the Rating column from the dataset to classify good and bad reviews.  

## Getting Started
* `notebooks` - My code for exploratory data analysis, topic modeling, clustering and classification models are in this folder.   
* `presentation` - This is the deck that I used to present in [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/). For references, please refer to the reference page in my deck.
